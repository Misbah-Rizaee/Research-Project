## Title
Investigating the potential of topic modelling on social media to support the identification of refugee needs

## Summary
In my research project I investigated the potential of topic modelling on social media to support the identification of refugee needs in near real-time.  I collected a significant amount of Twitter data through Twitterâ€™s API and pre-processed using natural language processing library. I used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) which is a statistical model to identify the latent themes in a collection of data to identify various topics from the tweets. Following the extraction of the topics using LDA topic modelling, it became clear which fundamental topics were being discussed in the collection of tweets. The findings of this research can also be used to highlight which groups of people require the most assistance.
